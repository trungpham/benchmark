0. install the dependencies
npm install
1. start the server
node server.js
2. start the services
PORT=3001 node service.js
PORT=3002 node service.js
PORT=3003 node service.js
3. run apache benchmark tool
ab  -n 9000 -c 30 "http://localhost:3000/"


Benchmark scenario:
Browser will issue a request to the proxy server. Internally, proxy server will make 3 out bound http calls to 3 different remote services in parallel. Only after those three requests completed, then proxy server can response back to the browser.

Result:
Sending 9000 requests directly to the service: 60.6s
Sending 9000 requests through the proxy:
NodeJS: +8s
Go: +30s
Java+Play2: +0s
Java+Rhino+Vertx: 0s
